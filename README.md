# Gender-Recognition-by-Voice
This is a Machine Learning Project. In this project we built Logistic Regression model and train it with a clean dataset. In training the model we used cross validation technique in order to select the best lambda value for the regularization term in order to make the model not over-fit the data nor under-fit the data.

it uses Matlab not python nor R.
